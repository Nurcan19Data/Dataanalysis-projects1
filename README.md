#SQL Queries for Transaction Analysis
This project contains SQL queries that are used to analyze transaction data, customer information, and transaction types within a database. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about customers, transactions, and ATM usage patterns.

Project Objective
These queries are designed to perform a variety of analyses, including:

Calculating the last transaction date for each customer and the number of days since.
Finding the customer with the highest transaction amount and their associated details.
Identifying customers who have never made a transaction.
Calculating the average transaction amount per customer.
Aggregating data by transaction types and summarizing total transaction amounts.
Analyzing transactions based on customer age groups.
