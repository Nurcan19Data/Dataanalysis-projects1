# Transaction Data Analysis Project

This repository contains SQL queries to analyze **transaction data** and gain insights into customer behavior, transaction amounts, and ATM usage. The project involves various SQL queries to extract valuable insights, such as identifying customers' most frequent transactions, segmenting customers by age group, and determining the largest transaction amount.

## Contents
- **SQL Queries**: A series of SQL queries to extract insights from the transaction and customer data.
- **Data Analysis**: Key metrics and analysis based on customer transaction data.

## SQL Queries

These queries are designed to perform a variety of analyses, including:

Calculating the last transaction date for each customer and the number of days since.
Finding the customer with the highest transaction amount and their associated details.
Identifying customers who have never made a transaction.
Calculating the average transaction amount per customer.
Aggregating data by transaction types and summarizing total transaction amounts.
Analyzing transactions based on customer age groups.

Highest Transaction Amount:

Finds the customer who made the highest transaction amount and their associated details.
Customers with No Transactions:

Counts the number of customers who have never made a transaction.
Average Transaction Amount Per Customer:

Calculates the average transaction amount for each customer.
Longest Transactions:

Retrieves the longest duration transactions by calculating the difference between transaction start and end times.
Transaction Type Summary:

Summarizes transaction counts and total amounts for each transaction type.
Age Group and Average Transaction Amount:

Categorizes customers into age groups and calculates the average transaction amount for each group.
Local vs Non-Local Transactions:

Counts transactions for local and non-local customers per ATM.
Top 10 Customers Using Multiple ATMs:

Identifies the top 10 customers who have used the most distinct ATMs.
Total Transaction Amount by Customer Type:

Sums the transaction amounts for customers based on their location (local or non-local).
Transactions with Unique Customer Names:

Identifies transactions made by customers with unique first names.
Yearly Transactions per Customer:

Breaks down transactions by year for each customer and sums the total transaction amount.
Most Frequent ATM per Customer:

Identifies the ATM that each customer uses the most.
Weekly Transaction Count and Average:

Retrieves the weekly transaction count and average transaction amount for each customer.
Difference Between Highest and Second Highest Transaction:

Calculates the difference between the highest and second-highest transaction amounts for customers who made at least two transactions.
